# This is the carbon calculator Demo App.

## Notes:
- Changes possibly needed for the demo:
  - Change values in the json file (since it has bad values)
## Getting Started & Testing
1. Requirements
- Node: please use one of the latest versions of node (14.16.1, >=15 should work). If there is an outdated node version, I recommend using the nvm package.
2. run 
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.  
The Carbon Calculator is at [http://localhost:3000/carbon-calculator](http://localhost:3000/carbon-calculator)  
The Eco footprint calculator is at [http://localhost:3000/ecoCalc](http://localhost:3000/eco-calculator)

## Production
There is an actual website deployed at [https://sets-deployment-clone.vercel.app/carbon-calculator](https://sets-deployment-clone.vercel.app/carbon-calculator). That should be what we will display
